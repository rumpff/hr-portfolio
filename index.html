          <section class="container">
            <p>While at Team Reptile I was responsible for a large chunk of UI Design & Programming, working closely with the artists and lead designer.  <br />
              <br />
              My primary responsibility designing and implementing the in-game phone and it's backend systems, which I had complete ownership of.<br />
              I designed a system in which other team members can create functional apps with, alongside tools for creating common features for the phone like (infitine) scrolling lists, app transitions, text animations, notifications and unlockable content tied with game progression.<br />
              <br />
              I wrote quite a few functional apps for the phone as well.</p>

        <h3>Unity Mania</h3>
        <section class="project-content">
          <section class="container">
            <p>I started this project with 2 goals: I wanted to create a rhythm game and I wanted to create a good looking UI.<br />
              <br />
              I chose to make a VSGR (vertical scrolling rhythm game) because they aren't super complicated which leaves room for me to make the UI. I did some research on how Stepmania, an old but robust VSGR, handles its song charts. Turns out that they're saved very conveniently which allowed me to write a parser for those files, which saved me a lot of time that I didn't have to spend on making my own editor.<br />

        <h3>BWZ</h3>
        <section class="project-content">
          <section class="container">
            <p>In bowZ players only have a bow, unlimited arrows, they move very fast and get instantly spliced in half when hit by an arrow. Once a player gets 4 kills in a row that player receives a bounty, and gives double points when killed. The first player that scores 15 points wins.<br />
              <br />
              Each bow has a special ability, which recharges over time and when the player makes a kill. Activating it will grant the player a special power for a limited time. For example, exploding arrows or teleportation.</p>
